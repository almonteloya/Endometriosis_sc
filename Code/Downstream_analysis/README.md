## Downstream analysis 

Note: After sub-setting cells and filtering, the output is three extra seurat objects:

* All cells (broad cell types)

* Only stromal cells and VSM (subset)

* Only epithelial cells (subset)

* Only immune cells (subset)


These objects were then used for downstream analysis for both broad and specific cell types for immune, stromal fibroblast, VSM, ciliated and unciliated epithelia. Endothelial cell analyis were performed based on object containing all cells.
