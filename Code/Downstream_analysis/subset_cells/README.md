### Subset cells

The merged object produced by harmony was annotated and then subset into specific subtypes: Stromal, immune and epithelial.

Note about filtering: Stromal and epithelial cells had clusters with immune markers. These are most likely doubles and were removed, then the object was reclustered. 
Epithelial cells had multiple cell clusters with MT content so they were filtered too and reclustered.
