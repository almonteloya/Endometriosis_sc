## Differential gene expression analysis 

* DEG broad: DEG of pristine control vs endometriosis, stratified by secretory or proliferative phases. Broad celltypes, stromal, VSM, unciliated epithelia, ciliated epithelia and endothelia. Using the seurat object containing all the celltypes. 

* DEG severity: DEG of (pristine control vs endometriosis I/II) and (pristine cotrol vs endometriosis III/IV) , stratified by secretory or proliferative phases. Broad celltypes, stromal, VSM, unciliated epithelia, ciliated epithelia and endothelia. Using the seurat object containing all the celltypes. 

* DEG fibroids: DEG of pristine control vs fibroids and endoemtrios vs fibroids, stratified by secretory or proliferative phases. Broad celltypes, stromal, VSM, unciliated epithelia, ciliated epithelia and endothelia. Using the seurat object containing all the celltypes. 

* DEG phase:  DEG of proliferative vs secretory, stratified by endometriosis, fibroid controls or pristine controls. Broad celltypes, stromal, VSM, unciliated epithelia, ciliated epithelia and endothelia. Using the seurat object containing all the celltypes. 


* DEG specific: DEG of pristine control vs endometriosis, stratified by secretory or proliferative phases. Specific stromal and epithelial subpopulations. Using stromal and epithelial objects. 

* DEG immune: DEG of pristine control vs endometriosis, stratified by secretory or proliferative phases. Specific immune subpopulations. Using immune objects.
